ChatBox â€“ Java Chat Application
Project Overview

   ChatBox is a simple client-server chat application built using Java Sockets and Multithreading. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and chat with each other in real time. The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, networking, and concurrency in Java.

Problem Statement

   In small groups (students, office teams, or local networks), communication is often limited to third-party apps. ChatBox solves this by providing a lightweight chat solution that runs directly in Java without internet dependency, ideal for LAN communication and learning Java networking.

Target Users

   Students practicing Java networking concepts

   Small teams working on local projects

   Beginners who want to understand multithreading and sockets

Features

   Multi-client real-time communication
   Server handles multiple clients with multithreading
   Encapsulation of user/message handling
   Simple command-line interface (CLI) (future-ready for Swing/JavaFX GUI)
   Clean modular code with comments

Tech Stack

   Language: Java

   Concepts: OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation), Multithreading, Sockets
